# Reference Section

This is the reference section—all kinds of good information in here!

**But these references are incomplete!** I've included a lot of the
common commands and their common features, but you need to check the
`man` pages for complete information! And there are a _zillion_ Unix
utilities that you can install that do a _billion zillion_ things. This
just covers most of POSIX and some other common ones.

It's not an exhaustive list because I'm far too lazy for that. Also I've
sworn off writing comprehensive books, so there!

So why do I even have this? Well, I'm trying to cover 90% of the common
usage here and hoping that it'll be enough that you can find info more
easily in the `man` pages. And I'm avoiding dragging you down with the
other 90% of the commands and options that represent less than 10% of
what you'll do.

These commands come in various flavors that I've labeled in the text.

* **POSIX**: this means that this is a POSIX standard command.
* **BUILT-IN**: this is typically, but not always, a shell built-in
  command.
* **SCRIPT**: this is typically used in a shell script, but can be used
  on the command line.
* **NON-STANDARD**: this is a commonly-installed command on a variety of
  Unix-likes, but it's not technically a POSIX-standard command.

Just because the command is POSIX and your system has it doesn't
necessarily mean that it will match these reference pages exactly. When
in doubt, check you own local `man` page for details.

I'd recommend skimming **all** of these synopses just to see what kind
of power you have in your hands. You can always look up the details
later.

**Again, all the commands listed here do more things than I talk
about!** I leave out all kinds of lesser-used options. The `man` pages
are the real references.
