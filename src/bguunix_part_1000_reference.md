# Reference Section

This is the reference sectionâ€”all kinds of good information in here!

**These references are incomplete!** I've included a lot of the common
commands and their common features, but you need to check the `man`
pages for complete information! And there are a _zillion_ Unix utilities
that you can install that do a _billion zillion_ things. This just
covers most of POSIX and some other common ones.

There are a lot of commands covered, but it's not an exhaustive list
because I'm far too lazy for that. Also I've sworn off writing
comprehensive books, so there!

These commands come in various flavors that I've labeled in the text.

* **POSIX**: this means that this is a POSIX standard command.
* **BUILT-IN**: this is typically, but not always, a shell built-in
  command.
* **SCRIPT**: this is typically used in a shell script, but can be used
  on the command line.

Just because the command is POSIX and your system has it doesn't
necessarily mean that it will match these reference pages exactly. When
in doubt, check you own local `man` page for details.

I'd recommend skimming **all** of these synopses just to see what kind
of power you have in your hands. You can always look up the details
later.
