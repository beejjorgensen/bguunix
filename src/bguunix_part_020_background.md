# Some Background

Before we launch into it, we need to define what _it_ actually is. I
think it's beneficial to hear a little bit of backstory. This will help
you understand why things are they way they are (we're looking at a
modern extension of some very old technology, after all) and allow you
to be more comfortable operating in the medium. I hope. At least it
sounds good.

## In the Beginning

A tiny fraction of moment after the Big Bang, cosmic inflation [_tape
fast-forwarding sounds_] called the _Late Heavy Bombardment_, the Earth
[_more fast-forwarding_] off the Yucatan peninsula was responsible for
[_fast-forwarding_] which allowed data to be stored on inexpensive
cassette tapes [_more fast-forwarding_] finally decoded the first
transmission from intelligent aliens from another world [..._rewinding
noises_] several computer terminals all connected to a single [_STOP
button pressed_].

Great! There we go! Let's start there.

Back in the 1970s, computers were _expensive_. I dug around for some
pricing, and it seems like a basic Digital Equipment Corporation (known
by the acronym _DEC_, or later just _Digital_) PDP-11/40 computer in
1973 cost about $17,000, which is equivalent to $128,000 in 2025
dollars. If you wanted to get all the serious bells and whistles
attached, you could easily push that 2025 cost north of $300K. And don't
forget the $2000/month in maintenance costs on top of that.

(And, yes, your cellphone is 1.21 zillion times more powerful than a
PDP-11/40.)

As such, it made no sense to buy a computer for all your employees.
T'would be madness!

What if we could instead hook up a bunch of cheap screens and keyboards
to that one big _mainframe_ computer? That way we just need to buy the
cheap screen and keyboard for all our employees and they can share the
mainframe.

The name for the cheap screen and keyboard? It was called a _computer
terminal_, or just a _terminal_ for short.

Keep in mind this is back in the day when virtually no one had their own
personal computer. Apple was just starting out.

These terminals TODO
