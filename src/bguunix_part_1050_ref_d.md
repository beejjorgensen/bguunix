## `date` {#man-date}

Print out the date and time.

^POSIX^ 
^SCRIPT^ 

### Synopsis {.unnumbered .unlisted}

``` {.default}
date [-u] [+format]
```

### Description {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This prints out the date and time. By default, it's the local time
printed in a semi-standard way.

You can get the Universal Time (UTC, which is basically GMT—forgive me,
time geeks), by giving it the `-u` switch.

The `format` string is more complicated, but it gives you full control
of what's printed. It does this by looking through the string looking
for `%` characters followed by a specific letter, called a _format
specifier_ (I stole that terminology from C). And then it does a
substitution for that specifier, putting something in its place. For
example, if it finds `%Y`, it prints out the current year at that point.
See the examples for more clarity.

Here are all the format specifiers, stolen directly out of the Single
Unix Specification:

|Specifier|Description|
|----|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`%a`|Locale's abbreviated weekday name.|
|`%A`|Locale's full weekday name.|
|`%b`|Locale's abbreviated month name.|
|`%B`|Locale's full month name.|
|`%c`|Locale's appropriate date and time representation.|
|`%C`|Century (a year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer) as a decimal number [00,99].|
|`%d`|Day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].|
|`%D`|Date in the format mm/dd/yy.|
|`%e`|Day of the month as a decimal number [1,31] in a two-digit field with leading space character fill.|
|`%h`|A synonym for %b.|
|`%H`|Hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23].|
|`%I`|Hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12].|
|`%j`|Day of the year as a decimal number [001,366].|
|`%m`|Month as a decimal number [01,12].|
|`%M`|Minute as a decimal number [00,59].|
|`%n`|A newline.|
|`%p`|Locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.|
|`%r`|12-hour clock time [01,12] using the AM/PM notation; in the POSIX locale, this shall be equivalent to %I : %M : %S %p.|
|`%S`|Seconds as a decimal number [00,60].|
|`%t`|A tab.|
|`%T`|24-hour clock time [00,23] in the format HH:MM:SS.|
|`%u`|Weekday as a decimal number [1,7] (1=Monday).|
|`%U`|Week of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Sunday shall be considered to be in week 0.|
|`%V`|Week of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [01,53]. If the week containing January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it shall be considered week 1; otherwise, it shall be the last week of the previous year, and the next week shall be week 1.|
|`%w`|Weekday as a decimal number [0,6] (0=Sunday).|
|`%W`|Week of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [00,53]. All days in a new year preceding the first Monday shall be considered to be in week 0.|
|`%x`|Locale's appropriate date representation.|
|`%X`|Locale's appropriate time representation.|
|`%y`|Year within century [00,99].|
|`%Y`|Year with century as a decimal number.|
|`%z`|Timezone numeric offset (non-standard).|
|`%:z`|Timezone numeric offset with colon between hours and minutes. (non-standard).|
|`%Z`|Timezone name, or no characters if no timezone is determinable.|
|`%%`|A percent-sign character.|

If you're superuser you can probably use this utility to set the time,
but that's something you should really never have to do on a modern
system.

### Example {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Standard printing of the date and time, both local and UTC:

``` {.default}
$ date
  Sat Oct 25 05:54:44 PM PDT 2025

$ date -u
  Sun Oct 26 12:54:46 AM UTC 2025
```

Using a format string:

``` {.default}
$ date +'The time is %I:%M %p. The year is %Y.'
  The time is 05:39 PM. The year is 2025.
```

Your version of `date` might have a switch to print the time in
[flw[ISO-8601|ISO_8601]] format, but let's do it the hard way for UTC.

``` {.default}
$ date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'
  2025-10-26T01:01:20Z
```

Some version of `date` support a timezone extension `%:z` that gives us
what we need to do ISO-8601 for local time:

``` {.default}
$ date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%:z'
  2025-10-25T18:02:58-07:00
```

## `dd` {#man-dd}

Copy and convert files.

^POSIX^ 

### Synopsis {.unnumbered .unlisted}

``` {.default}
dd [operand...]
```

### Description {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This is a rarely used utility, but it is good for copying data a block
at a time. Normally you'd just use `cp`, but `dd` gives you more control
over the input and output. When in doubt, use `cp`.

`dd` also copies a _block_ at a time. The default size of a block is 512
bytes, but you can change it.

The operands that you can use are below, but note that this isn't a
typical command line format for Unix. For example, to copy `foo` to
`bar`, we could run the following, setting the input file name with
`if=` and the output file name with `of=`. That makes a copy, and notice
that `dd` also prints out some accounting information:

``` {.default}
$ dd if=foo.sh of=bar.sh
  0+1 records in
  0+1 records out
  66 bytes copied, 5.4194e-05 s, 1.2 MB/s
```

The output `0+1` means that zero full blocks were read and one partial
block was read (or written). (This was a small file.) It also prints out
the total bytes copied, how long it took, and the throughput.

|Operand|Description|
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|`if=file`|Set the input file.|
|`of=file`|Set the output file.|
|`ibs=expr`|Set the input block size.|
|`obs=expr`|Set the output block size.|
|`bs=expr`|Set both input and output block size.|
|`cbs=expr`|Set conversion block size (for use with `block`, below).|
|`skip=n`|Skip _n_ blocks of input before copying.|
|`seek=n`|Skip _n_ blocks of output before copying.|
|`count=n`|Copy only _n_ input blocks.|
|`conv=value[,value]`|Set the conversion type.|

If the input file is omitted, standard input is used. If the output file
is omitted—guess what—standard output is used.

Block sizes can be specified in bytes (no suffix), kilobytes (`k`
suffix), or multiples of 512 bytes ("blocks") (`b` suffix, because they
want to make this confusing. `b` means "512-byte blocks", not "bytes").

``` {.default}
bs=4096     # 4096 bytes
bs=4k       # 4 kilobytes, 4096 bytes
bs=8b       # 8 blocks of 512 bytes, 4096 bytes
```

And also as the product of two numbers separated by a literal `x`. I'll
bet only 5% of Unix hackers knew about this. I didn't.

``` {.default}
bs=4x1024   # 4 times 1024 = 4096 bytes
bs=4x1k     # 4 times 1 kilobyte = 4096 bytes
bs=2x4b     # 2 times 4 blocks (2048 bytes) = 4096 bytes
```

Some versions of `dd` support other units besides just `k` and `b`.

Finally, that crazy conversion stuff. This gives you more control over
the output, some of it in a very dated way.

|`conv=` operand|Description|
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|`block`|Turn newline-delimited records into flat records, length given by `cbs=`.|
|`unblock`|Turn flat records into newline-delimited records, length given by `cbs=`.|
|`lcase`|Map uppercase letters in input to lowercase in output. Capitalize it!|
|`ucase`|Map lowercase letters in input to uppercase in output. Lowercasize it!|
|`noerror`|Don't give up on error. If `sync` is specified, fill the error block with null bytes. Otherwise, just skip it.|
|`notrunc`|Don't nuke the output file before writing.|
|`sync`|Pad every input block out to the input block size with null bytes (or with spaces if used with `block` or `unblock`).|
|`ascii`|Convert [flw[EBCDIC|EBCDIC]] to ASCII. You won't need this.|
|`ebcdic`|Convert ASCII to EBCDIC. You won't need this.|
|`ibm`|Convert ASCII to IBM EBCDIC. You **will** need this. Just kidding—you won't.|
|`swab`|Swap every pair of bytes. Good for [flw[endianness|Endianness]] swaps, I guess.|

`block` and `unblock` are particularly interesting if you need to
generate flat files (where each record is the same number of bytes). It
pads with spaces, which apparently is how [flw[Fortran|Fortran]] likes
things.

This is an *old* program.

And `ucase` and `lcase` are fun.

And `notrunc` would allow you to "paste" blocks in place in an existing
file. Using `seek` and `skip` allow you to position where you want the
block exactly.

A common use of this is to copy entire raw disks a block at a time. Or
to slice and dice files.

Another use is to create big files full of null bytes by using
`/dev/zero` as the input file.

### Example {.unnumbered .unlisted}

Copy a file:

``` {.default}
$ dd if=input.txt of=output.txt
```

Copy a file specifying block size:

``` {.default}
$ dd if=input.txt of=output.txt bs=4096
```

Convert a file to uppercase, printing it on standard output:

``` {.default}
$ dd if=input.txt conv=ucase
```

Create a 8 KB file (made up of two 4 KB blocks) of null bytes from
`/dev/zero`

``` {.default
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=foo.txt bs=4k count=2
```

Convert a file with newline-delimited TODO
