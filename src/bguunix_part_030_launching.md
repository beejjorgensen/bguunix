# Launching the Terminal

## MacOS

This is the easiest.

1. Hit `CMD-SPACE`.
2. Type `terminal`.
3. Choose "Terminal" from the command list and run it.

You should also drag it down to the dock since you'll be running it
frequently.

And you're in! There's the shell prompt. Jump to [exiting the
terminal](#exiting1), below.

## Windows

If you're going to learn Unix on Windows, I recommend one of two things:

1. [fl[Install
   WSL|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install]].
2. [fl[Install Git Bash|https://git-scm.com/downloads/win]], part of the
   Git version control system.

## Unix-likes

These vary depending on how you have them configured, so it's hard to
give the definitive set of instructions. But it's common that you can
right-click on the desktop and there will be a shell option in the
context menu.

And certainly there are more ways to open them than that. I open shells
so frequently I bound `SHIFT-F1` to that action to make it as effortless
as possible.

## Exiting the terminal {#exiting1}

At the shell prompt, hit `CTRL-d` or type `exit` and hit `RETURN`.
Either one will cause the shell to exit.

Depending on your configuration, the terminal window might instantly
close, or it might need to be manually closed.
